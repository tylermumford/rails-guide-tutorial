# Getting Started with Rails

I decided to run this all in Docker. The setup is based on
[this Quickstart documentation](https://docs.docker.com/samples/rails/).

This project is a simple blog, as described in [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I've played with Ruby before, but this is my first time using Rails.

Tip: `alias dcrw="docker compose run web"`

Development: `docker compose up`
